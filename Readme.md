#Real-Time Geolocation Tracking System

This project aims to create a robust real-time tracking system based on geolocation data, providing users with an interactive map displaying their current location and historical movements. The system utilizes Angular for the frontend, Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB as the NoSQL database. Additionally, it incorporates external APIs such as Leaflet for geolocation data and OpenWeather for real-time weather conditions. The system ensures security, compliance with GDPR regulations, and horizontal scalability for optimal performance.
